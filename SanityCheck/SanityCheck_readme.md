# Sanity Check

This is a readme for our Sanity Check. It was meant to check experiments outcomes for 00, 000, 11, 111 measurements
only. 

## Circuit naming convention

For sanity check experiments following circuit naming convention shall be used:

```
SC_initial-state[_B]
```

where SC is the basic name of experiments, initial-state is self-explanatory and optional parameter B denotes if 
barrier was used. For example

```
SC_11_B
```

means that the experiment was sanity check with initial state 11 and barrier.
