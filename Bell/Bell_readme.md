# Bell

This is a readme for our Bell test experiments.

## Circuit naming convention

For Bell experiments following circuit naming convention shall be used:

```
Bell_circuitNumber
```

where Bell is general name of experiments and circuit number denotes number of circuit clone. Therefore


```
Bell_2
```

will get the experimental data from 2nd clone of Bell circuit.
