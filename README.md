This is a project containing 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

For development and running:

* Python 3.5 or higher
* qiskit 0.6.1 python package (currently, as it's evolving fast)
* IBM QX account (to run jobs remotely)

### After download:

One should generate a Qconfig file and place it in the main folder (one with readme and license). After that all scripts should work just fine.

### Coding style

Although it hasn't been said explicitely, we're trying to maintain PEP8 in Python scripts. There currently is no coding style for qasms and other files used.

## Run with

Python interpreter of your choice, that fulfills prerequisites.
